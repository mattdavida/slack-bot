# slack-bot

A simple conversational bot made for slack.  

1.npm install

2.Update DB connection - line 18 app.js 

3.Enter token - line 28 app.js

In order to have a conversation: 

1. [Join the Slack Channel](https://chatbottest-global.slack.com/shared_invite/MTg1NDIyMzEzODYwLTE0OTUxNDM0NDAtODU0ZDM1MjIwMA)
2. Send a direct message to super_awesome_bot that says "hello" or "question"
3. Answer all the questions. (Once finished, the results are saved to MongoDB)

I was able to get this app started thanks to the help of this article [here](https://www.codementor.io/dominicscanlan/creating-a-slack-bot-using-node-js-vgwto3mu6).
